# Trajectory Design for Space Systems 
This repository contains the examples and homework examples for the [`Trajectory Design for Space Systems (EN.530.626)`](https://acelab.me.jhu.edu/trajdesign/) class taught at Johns Hopkins University.
We provide instructions on how to build the `Docker` container for installing the necessary software packages for the course.
